Actually the static bitmap widget is being resized to fill the whole 
frame on both platforms, (this is a feature of wxFrame, that if it has 
only one child then that child is moved/sized such that it fills the 
frame's client area.)  The widgets just have different behaviors when 
the widget is larger than the image.

You can override the frame's default one child behavior by using a sizer 
instead of absolute positioning and sizing.  Or you can use a panel as 
the only child of the frame and then make that panel be the parent of 
the static bitmap widget.  It would still be a good idea to use a sizer 
on the panel, but absolute positioning/sizing would work too.
