Hello,

Because I'm currently building a simple cross platform Python GUI
application, I decided to use wxPython. All went fine until I ran in
the following issue.

I have a wx.Frame, with a certain image on it (wx.StaticBitmap). This
image needs to 'start' on (0,0), the left upper corner of the
wx.Frame. In short, this became the code below [2], using the image
[3]. Strangely this code is behaving differently on Windows and
Linux.

On Linux, this code behaves as expected. The (small) image is placed
on the left upper corner. It looks like this:

On Windows, however, the resulting frame is different. The image is
placed in the center of the frame, as can be seen here:
http://med.hro.nl/vlikb/wxpython/bitmap_placement_windows.png

In my understanding, the image should be in the upper left corner as
well. Does anyone know how this can happen? And how this can be fixed?
The images need to 'start' at (0,0), even on Windows.

A minimal testcase can be found at [1].

Regards,

Kevin van der Vlist

        wx.Frame.__init__(self, parent=None, title=title, pos=pos,
size=size)

        bm = wx.BitmapFromImage(wx.Image("bitmap_placement.png",
wx.BITMAP_TYPE_PNG))

        self.bitmap = wx.StaticBitmap(parent=self, pos=pos, bitmap=bm,

        self.frame = Frame()
        self.frame.Show()
