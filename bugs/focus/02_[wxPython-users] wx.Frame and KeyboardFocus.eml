On some platforms the frames can not deal with key events, try putting a 
panel or some other window type in the frame and bind the event handler 
there.

Checking HasFocus would be a better test there.

import wx
print wx.version()

class Frame(wx.Frame):
     def __init__(self, title):
         wx.Frame.__init__(self, None, title=title, size=(350,200))
         pnl = wx.Panel(self)
         pnl.SetFocus()
         pnl.Bind(wx.EVT_KEY_DOWN, self.KeyBoardEvent)
         print "Focus?: " + str(pnl.HasFocus())

     def KeyBoardEvent(self, event):
         print event

if __name__ == '__main__':
     app = wx.App()
     fr = Frame("wx.EVT_KEY_DOWN")
     fr.Show()
     app.MainLoop()
