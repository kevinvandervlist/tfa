Hello guys,

Today I'm busy writing a simple wxPython application, but I have some
problems with it. As soon as I want to attach a Keyboard listener,
wx.Bind() returns as expected, but events won't be registered.

Below is a minimal test case of the situation I expect to work. Do you
know why the KeyBoardEvent() function isn't triggered? The frame even
explicitly asks for focus, but the function is never called.
self.AcceptsFocusFromKeyboard() also returns false.

#!/usr/bin/python
import wx

class Frame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, title):
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, None, title=title, size=(350,200))
        self.SetFocus()
        self.Bind(wx.EVT_KEY_DOWN, self.KeyBoardEvent)
        print "Focus?: " + str(self.AcceptsFocusFromKeyboard())

    def KeyBoardEvent(self, event):
        print event

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = wx.App()
    fr = Frame("wx.EVT_KEY_DOWN")
    fr.Show()
    app.MainLoop()
